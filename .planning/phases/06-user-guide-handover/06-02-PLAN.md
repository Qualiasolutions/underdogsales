## Chat Coaching

### What You Can Do
Get instant answers to sales questions from an AI coach trained on the Underdog Sales methodology. Ask about techniques, get advice on specific situations, or clarify concepts from the curriculum.

### How to Use Chat Coaching

1. **Navigate to Chat**
   - Click "Coach" or "Chat" in the main navigation

2. **Ask Your Question**
   - Type your question in the message box
   - Be specific for better answers
   - Examples:
     - "How do I handle the 'send me an email' objection?"
     - "What's the best opener for a CFO?"
     - "Explain the negative framing technique"

3. **Review the Response**
   - The AI coach responds with methodology-based advice
   - Responses reference Underdog Sales concepts
   - Follow-up questions are welcome

### Best Practices for Chat Coaching

- **Be Specific:** "How do I handle budget objections?" beats "Help with objections"
- **Share Context:** "I'm calling CFOs at mid-market companies..." helps tailor advice
- **Ask Follow-Ups:** Dig deeper if the first answer needs clarification
- **Apply and Practice:** Use Voice Practice to test the advice

### Example Questions

| Topic | Example Question |
|-------|------------------|
| Openers | "What's a good permission-based opener for a gatekeeper?" |
| Discovery | "How do I get prospects to give concrete examples?" |
| Objections | "The prospect says they're not interested - what do I do?" |
| Closing | "How do I ask for a meeting without using trigger words?" |
| General | "Why does the methodology focus on problems over benefits?" |

---

## Curriculum

### What You Can Do
Study the Underdog Sales methodology through 12 structured modules. Each module covers a core concept with explanations, techniques, and examples.

### Curriculum Modules

| # | Module | What You'll Learn |
|---|--------|-------------------|
| 1 | Call Structure | Complete cold call flow from opener to close |
| 2 | Openers | Permission-based openers with 79-89% success rates |
| 3 | The Pitch | Problem-focused pitches that resonate 2x stronger |
| 4 | Discovery | Getting examples, impact, and root cause |
| 5 | Objections | Framework for handling any objection calmly |
| 6 | Closing | Negative framing and securing commitment |
| 7 | Gatekeeper | Techniques to reach decision makers |
| 8 | Psychology | Why these techniques work (science-based) |
| 9 | Attitude | Mindset and self-talk for cold calling success |
| 10 | Disqualification | Testing prospects to find real opportunities |
| 11 | Advanced Techniques | Enterprise and C-level strategies |
| 12 | Review & Practice | Putting it all together with scenarios |

### How to Use the Curriculum

1. **Navigate to Curriculum**
   - Click "Curriculum" in the main navigation
   - You'll see all 12 modules with progress indicators

2. **Select a Module**
   - Click on a module card to open it
   - Read through the content at your own pace
   - Key concepts are highlighted

3. **Track Your Progress**
   - Completed modules show a checkmark
   - Your progress is saved automatically
   - Resume where you left off

### Recommended Learning Path

**New to Cold Calling:**
1. Start with Module 1 (Call Structure) for the big picture
2. Work through Modules 2-6 in order (core techniques)
3. Practice each module's techniques in Voice Practice
4. Finish with Modules 7-12 (advanced topics)

**Experienced Salespeople:**
1. Skim Module 1 to understand the framework

## Dashboard

### What You Can Do
Track your practice history, view progress over time, and identify areas for improvement. The Dashboard is your home base for monitoring growth.

### Dashboard Sections

**History Tab:**
- **Practice Sessions:** All your Voice Practice sessions with dates and scores
- **Call Analyses:** All uploaded recordings with analysis results
- Click any session to view the full transcript and feedback

**Progress Tab:**
- **Score Trends:** Line chart showing your scores over time
- **Dimension Breakdown:** Radar chart comparing performance across all 6 dimensions
- **Curriculum Progress:** Visual tracker of completed modules

### Reading Your Progress

**Score Trend Chart:**
- X-axis: Date of practice sessions
- Y-axis: Overall score (1-10)
- Reference line at 7.0 (target competency level)
- Upward trend indicates improvement

**Dimension Radar Chart:**
- 6 axes representing each scoring dimension
- Larger area = stronger overall performance
- Look for "dips" to identify weak areas
- Compare against the target (7.0) on each dimension

**Curriculum Progress:**
- Green checkmarks = completed modules
- Gray circles = not started
- Progress bar shows overall completion percentage

### Using Dashboard Insights

1. **Identify Weak Dimensions**
   - Look at radar chart for lowest scores
   - Review the corresponding curriculum module
   - Focus Voice Practice on that dimension

2. **Track Improvement**
   - Compare scores week-over-week
   - Celebrate when you cross the 7.0 line
   - Notice patterns in what works

3. **Stay Consistent**
   - Regular practice shows clear trends
   - Sporadic practice makes patterns hard to see
   - Aim for 2-3 sessions per week minimum

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Getting Started

**Q: What browser should I use?**
A: Chrome is recommended for best voice quality. Firefox and Safari work but may have minor audio differences.

**Q: Do I need to install anything?**
A: No installation needed. Just log in through your browser. You'll need to allow microphone access for Voice Practice.

**Q: How do I get an account?**
A: Contact your administrator for login credentials. Accounts are created by your organization's admin.

### Voice Practice

**Q: The AI seems too harsh - is that normal?**
A: Yes! The personas are designed to be challenging, simulating difficult prospects you'll encounter in real life. Start with Medium difficulty personas if Hard feels overwhelming.

**Q: Can I practice the same persona multiple times?**
A: Absolutely. Practice with the same persona until you consistently score 7+ before moving to harder ones.

**Q: Why does the AI sometimes hang up on me?**
A: The AI simulates realistic prospect behavior. If you trigger a dismissal (e.g., not asking for permission, being too pushy), they'll end the call just like a real prospect would.

**Q: My score seems lower than I expected - why?**
A: The AI scores based on specific methodology criteria, not general salesmanship. Review the transcript to see exactly what was said. Often, missing one key technique (like asking for permission) significantly impacts the score.

### Call Analysis

**Q: Can I upload phone call recordings?**
A: Yes, as long as the audio is in a supported format (MP3, WAV, M4A, WebM) and under 25MB. Phone recordings work well.

**Q: How long does analysis take?**
A: Typically 2-3 minutes for a 10-minute call. Longer calls take proportionally longer. You can leave the page and check back later.

**Q: Why is the transcription not perfect?**
A: Speech-to-text technology works best with clear audio. Background noise, crosstalk, and accents can affect accuracy. The analysis focuses on patterns, so minor transcription errors usually don't affect scoring.

### Scoring

**Q: What's a good score?**
A: 7+ is considered competent. 9+ is excellent. Most people start in the 4-6 range and improve with practice.

**Q: Why is Discovery weighted so heavily (25%)?**
A: Discovery is where real selling happens. Getting prospects to share examples, impact, and root cause creates the foundation for everything else.

**Q: How can I improve my Communication score?**
A: Focus on listening more (< 40% talk time), reducing filler words (um, uh, like), and speaking clearly at a moderate pace.

### Technical Issues

**Q: Voice Practice won't start - what do I do?**
A: Check microphone permissions in your browser, ensure you're on a stable internet connection, and try refreshing the page.

**Q: I can't log in.**
A: Clear your browser cache, try incognito mode, or contact your administrator if the issue persists.

**Q: The page is loading slowly.**
A: Check your internet connection. If the problem persists, try a different browser or device.

### Key Methodology Reminders

- **Ask permission first** - "You weren't expecting my call, but I hope you can help..."
- **Lead with problems** - 2x more effective than benefits
- **Get an example** - No example = no real problem
- **Pause before responding to objections** - 2-3 seconds
- **Use negative framing to close** - "Would it be a bad idea to..."
- **Listen more than you talk** - Target < 40% talk time
