<objective>
Create TRAINING.md (training session materials) and HANDOVER_CHECKLIST.md (client handover tracking).

Purpose: The client needs materials to train their team on the platform and a checklist to confirm all handover items are complete. This closes out the documentation requirements (DOC-02, DOC-03).

Output: `docs/TRAINING.md` and `docs/HANDOVER_CHECKLIST.md`

# Underdog AI Sales Coach - Training Session Guide

This guide helps facilitators run an effective training session for the Underdog AI Sales Coach platform.

## Overview

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Duration | 75-90 minutes |
| Format | Interactive demo + hands-on practice |
| Audience | Sales team members |
| Prerequisites | User accounts created, attendees logged in |
| Materials | This guide, live platform access, headsets/mics |

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, participants will be able to:

1. Start and complete a Voice Practice session
2. Upload and analyze a call recording
3. Use Chat Coaching to get methodology answers
4. Navigate the Curriculum and track progress
5. Interpret their scores and identify improvement areas

---

## Training Agenda

### Part 1: Platform Introduction (10 minutes)

**Goal:** Establish context and excitement for the tool.

**Facilitator Script:**
> "Welcome to the Underdog AI Sales Coach. This platform lets you practice cold calls with AI prospects that respond like real executives. You'll get scored on the Underdog methodology and get specific feedback on every call."

**Cover:**
- What the platform does (practice, analysis, coaching, curriculum)
- Why AI practice helps (unlimited reps, no judgment, instant feedback)
- Quick tour of the main navigation (Practice, Analyze, Coach, Curriculum, Dashboard)

**Tip:** Keep this brief. Salespeople want to do, not watch.

---

### Part 2: Voice Practice Demo + Exercise (30 minutes)

**Goal:** Everyone completes their first practice session.

#### Demo (5 minutes)

1. Navigate to Practice page
2. Explain persona cards (difficulty, description)
3. Select a Medium difficulty persona (Lisa Martinez recommended)
4. Start call, demonstrate 30-60 seconds of conversation
5. End call, show results page
6. Walk through score dimensions and transcript

**Key Points to Emphasize:**
- Permission-based opener is critical
- Focus on problems, not features
- The AI is intentionally challenging

#### Hands-On Exercise (25 minutes)

**Instructions for Participants:**

> "Now it's your turn. Everyone select Lisa Martinez (Head of Operations) - she's challenging but fair. Complete a full practice call. You have 10 minutes for the call itself."

**Steps:**
1. Participants navigate to Practice
2. Select Lisa Martinez persona
3. Complete a practice call (5-10 minutes each)
4. Review results

**Debrief Questions:**
- "What was your overall score?"
- "Which dimension was your lowest?"
- "What surprised you about the AI's responses?"

**Common Issues:**
- Microphone not working → Check browser permissions
- Nervous/hesitant → Remind them it's just AI, no judgment
- Low scores → Expected for first time, improvement comes with practice

---

### Part 3: Call Analysis Demo (15 minutes)

**Goal:** Understand how to analyze real call recordings.

#### Demo (5 minutes)

1. Navigate to Analyze page
2. Show supported file formats
3. Upload a sample recording (prepare a ~2 minute sample in advance)
4. Wait for processing (or use a pre-analyzed example)
5. Walk through the analysis results

**Key Points:**
- Same scoring as Voice Practice
- Works with phone recordings
- Can leave page during processing

#### Discussion (10 minutes)

> "Think about your last 5 real sales calls. Which ones would benefit from this analysis?"

**Prompt Questions:**
- "Who has a call they wish they could replay and analyze?"
- "How would reviewing your real calls with this lens help?"
- "What patterns might you discover across multiple analyses?"

---

### Part 4: Chat Coaching + Curriculum (15 minutes)

**Goal:** Know how to get answers and learn the methodology.

#### Chat Coaching Demo (5 minutes)

1. Navigate to Coach/Chat
2. Ask: "How do I handle the 'I'm not interested' objection?"
3. Show the response
4. Ask a follow-up question
5. Demonstrate the conversational nature

**Encourage Participants:**
> "If you're ever stuck on a technique or want advice on a specific situation, ask the coach."

#### Curriculum Overview (5 minutes)

1. Navigate to Curriculum
2. Show the 12 module overview
3. Open one module (suggest Module 2: Openers)
4. Show the content format
5. Explain progress tracking

**Key Points:**
- Self-paced learning
- Complements practice sessions
- Complete all 12 for full methodology

#### Quick Exercise (5 minutes)

> "Everyone open Module 1: Call Structure. Read the Call Flow section (30 seconds). Now, can someone tell me the 9 steps?"

---

### Part 5: Dashboard + Wrap-Up (15 minutes)

**Goal:** Know how to track progress and next steps.

#### Dashboard Demo (5 minutes)

1. Navigate to Dashboard
2. Show History tab (their practice session should appear)
3. Show Progress tab (explain score trends, radar chart)
4. Explain how to identify weak areas

**Key Point:**
> "This is your home base. Check here regularly to see your improvement."

#### Q&A (5 minutes)

Open floor for questions.

**Common Questions:**
- "How often should I practice?" → 2-3 sessions per week minimum
- "Which persona should I focus on?" → Master Medium before Hard
- "What's a good target score?" → 7+ is competent, 9+ is excellent

#### Next Steps (5 minutes)

**Action Items for Participants:**
1. Complete 3 Voice Practice sessions this week
2. Upload 1 real call for analysis
3. Complete Curriculum Modules 1-3
4. Check your Dashboard progress

**Close:**
> "The more you practice, the faster you improve. Every session builds muscle memory. Go make some calls!"

## Troubleshooting During Training

| Issue | Quick Fix |
|-------|-----------|
| Microphone not detected | Settings > Privacy > Microphone > Allow for Chrome |
| Platform slow | Check internet; have participants try one at a time |
| Participant can't log in | Admin creates new password; try incognito mode |

## Post-Training Follow-Up

---

## Appendix: Sample Questions for Chat Coach

For the Chat Coaching demo, use these to show variety:

1. "What's the best opener for a VP of Sales?"
2. "How do I handle the 'just send me an email' brush-off?"
3. "Why does the methodology say to focus on problems instead of benefits?"
4. "What should I do if the prospect goes silent?"
5. "How do I close without using the word 'meeting'?"
