```

**Voice Practice section (main content of this task):**

```markdown
## Voice Practice

### What You Can Do
Practice cold calls with AI prospects that respond like real executives. Each conversation is scored against the Underdog Sales methodology.

### Before You Start
- [ ] Using Chrome browser (recommended)
- [ ] Microphone connected and working
- [ ] Quiet environment for clear audio
- [ ] Logged into your account

### Choosing a Persona

| Persona | Role | Difficulty | What to Expect |
|---------|------|------------|----------------|
| Sarah Chen | CFO | Hard | Skeptical, ROI-focused, no patience for fluff |
| Marcus Johnson | VP of Sales | Hard | Aggressive, interruptive, results-only mindset |
| Tony Ricci | Sales Director | Hard | Combative, tests everything you say |
| Emily Torres | Executive Assistant | Medium | Protective gatekeeper, dismissive |
| David Park | Sales Manager | Medium | Territorial, defensive about his team |
| Lisa Martinez | Head of Operations | Medium | Stressed, wants solutions but hates process |

**Tip:** Start with Medium difficulty personas to build confidence before tackling Hard ones.

### Step-by-Step: Running a Practice Session

1. **Navigate to Practice**
   - Click "Practice" in the main navigation
   - You'll see the persona selection screen

2. **Select Your Persona**
   - Review the difficulty levels and descriptions
   - Click on a persona card to select them
   - Read the scenario brief that appears

3. **Start the Call**
   - Click the "Start Call" button
   - Allow microphone access when prompted (first time only)
   - Wait for the connection (1-2 seconds)
   - The AI will answer as that persona

4. **During the Call**
   - Speak naturally as if on a real cold call
   - The AI responds in real-time based on what you say
   - Apply Underdog Sales techniques (permission-based opener, problem focus, etc.)
   - The call continues until you or the AI ends it

5. **End the Call**
   - Click "End Call" when you're done
   - Or the AI may hang up if you trigger a realistic dismissal
   - Wait for scoring to process (5-10 seconds)

6. **Review Your Results**
   - You'll be redirected to the results page
   - See your overall score and dimension breakdown
   - Read the full transcript with highlights
   - Review AI feedback on specific moments

### Understanding Your Score

Your performance is scored across 6 dimensions based on the Underdog Sales methodology:

| Dimension | Weight | What It Measures |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| Opener | 15% | Permission-based approach, attention grab, tone |
| Pitch | 15% | Problem-focused, specific ICP, template usage |
| Discovery | 25% | Getting examples, understanding impact, finding root cause |
| Objection Handling | 20% | Pause, acknowledge, permission to probe, calm demeanor |
| Closing | 15% | Summary, emotion test, negative framing, avoiding triggers |
| Communication | 10% | Talk ratio, filler words, pace, clarity |

**Score Interpretation:**
- **9-10:** Excellent - Masterful application of techniques
- **7-8:** Good - Solid performance with minor improvements possible
- **5-6:** Average - Foundations present, significant room to grow
- **3-4:** Needs Work - Key techniques missing or poorly executed
- **1-2:** Poor - Fundamental methodology not applied

**Target Score:** Aim for 7+ to demonstrate competency in each dimension.

### Tips for Best Results

1. **Permission-Based Openers Work**
   - "You weren't expecting my call, but I hope you can help..." (89% success rate)
   - Always ask for permission to continue

2. **Focus on Problems, Not Features**
   - Lead with 2-3 problems you solve
   - Let them pick which resonates most

3. **Get a Concrete Example**
   - "Can you give me an example of when that happened?"
   - No example = no real problem

4. **Use Negative Framing to Close**
   - "Would it be a bad idea to explore this further?"
   - Avoid: meeting, demo, calendar, discovery

5. **Listen More Than You Talk**
   - Target <40% talk time
   - Let them convince YOU the problem matters

### Troubleshooting Voice Practice

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Microphone not detected | Check browser permissions (Settings > Privacy > Microphone) |
| Call won't start | Refresh page, ensure stable internet connection |
| AI not responding | Wait 2-3 seconds, speak clearly, avoid background noise |
| Score seems wrong | Review transcript - AI scores based on actual words spoken |
| Call dropped unexpectedly | Connection issue - try again with stable WiFi |
```

Ensure all persona names match exactly from `src/config/personas.ts`.
Ensure scoring dimensions and weights match exactly from `src/config/rubric.ts`.
Use clear, non-technical language appropriate for salespeople.

## Call Analysis

### What You Can Do
Upload recordings of your real sales calls and get AI-powered analysis with the same scoring used in Voice Practice. Identify patterns across multiple calls to accelerate improvement.

### Before You Start
- [ ] Audio file ready (MP3, WAV, M4A, or WebM format)
- [ ] File size under 25MB
- [ ] Recording is primarily your sales conversation (not music or unrelated audio)

### Supported Audio Formats

| Format | Extension | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| MP3 | .mp3 | Most common, recommended |
| WAV | .wav | High quality, larger files |
| M4A | .m4a | iPhone recordings |
| WebM | .webm | Browser recordings |

### Step-by-Step: Analyzing a Call

1. **Navigate to Analyze**
   - Click "Analyze" in the main navigation
   - You'll see the upload interface

2. **Upload Your Recording**
   - Click "Choose File" or drag and drop your audio file
   - Wait for the upload to complete (progress bar shown)
   - Larger files take longer to upload

3. **Wait for Processing**
   - Transcription: 1-2 minutes depending on call length
   - Scoring: Additional 30 seconds
   - You can leave the page - analysis continues in background
   - Check back on your Dashboard to see completed analyses

4. **Review the Analysis**
   - Full transcript with speaker labels
   - Overall score and dimension breakdown (same 6 dimensions as Voice Practice)
   - Specific feedback on key moments
   - Suggested improvements

### Understanding Call Analysis Results

The analysis uses the same 6 scoring dimensions as Voice Practice:
- Opener (15%), Pitch (15%), Discovery (25%)
- Objection Handling (20%), Closing (15%), Communication (10%)

**Key Differences from Voice Practice:**
- Analysis handles real conversations with natural interruptions
- Speaker detection separates your voice from the prospect's
- Context is inferred from the full conversation, not a scenario

### Tips for Accurate Analysis

1. **Clear Audio Quality**
   - Use a decent microphone or phone recorder
   - Minimize background noise
   - Both parties should be audible

2. **Complete Conversations**
   - Include the full call from greeting to goodbye
   - Partial recordings may score lower on Closing

3. **One Conversation Per File**
   - Don't combine multiple calls into one file
   - Each analysis is for one sales conversation

### Troubleshooting Call Analysis

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Upload fails | Check file size (<25MB), try different format |
| Transcription taking too long | Long calls take longer; check Dashboard for status |
| Poor transcription accuracy | Audio quality issue - use clearer recording next time |
| Score lower than expected | Review transcript - AI scores what it hears, not intent |
| Speaker labels wrong | Common with similar voices - focus on the feedback content |
