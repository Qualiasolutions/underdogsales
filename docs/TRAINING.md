## Training Agenda

### Part 1: Platform Introduction (10 minutes)

**Goal:** Establish context and excitement for the tool.

**Facilitator Script:**
> "Welcome to the Underdog AI Sales Coach. This platform lets you practice cold calls with AI prospects that respond like real executives. You'll get scored on the Underdog methodology and get specific feedback on every call."

**Cover:**
- What the platform does (practice, analysis, coaching, curriculum)
- Why AI practice helps (unlimited reps, no judgment, instant feedback)
- Quick tour of the main navigation (Practice, Analyze, Coach, Curriculum, Dashboard)

**Tip:** Keep this brief. Salespeople want to do, not watch.

### Part 2: Voice Practice Demo + Exercise (30 minutes)

**Goal:** Everyone completes their first practice session.

#### Demo (5 minutes)

1. Navigate to Practice page
2. Explain persona cards (difficulty, description)
3. Select a Medium difficulty persona (Lisa Martinez recommended)
4. Start call, demonstrate 30-60 seconds of conversation
5. End call, show results page
6. Walk through score dimensions and transcript

**Key Points to Emphasize:**
- Permission-based opener is critical
- Focus on problems, not features
- The AI is intentionally challenging

#### Hands-On Exercise (25 minutes)

**Instructions for Participants:**

> "Now it's your turn. Everyone select Lisa Martinez (Head of Operations) - she's challenging but fair. Complete a full practice call. You have 10 minutes for the call itself."

**Steps:**
1. Participants navigate to Practice
2. Select Lisa Martinez persona
3. Complete a practice call (5-10 minutes each)
4. Review results

**Debrief Questions:**
- "What was your overall score?"
- "Which dimension was your lowest?"
- "What surprised you about the AI's responses?"

**Common Issues:**
- Microphone not working → Check browser permissions
- Nervous/hesitant → Remind them it's just AI, no judgment
- Low scores → Expected for first time, improvement comes with practice
