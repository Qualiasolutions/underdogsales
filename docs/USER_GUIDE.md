## Voice Practice

### What You Can Do

Practice cold calls with AI prospects that respond like real executives. Each conversation is scored against the Underdog Sales methodology, giving you immediate feedback on what you did well and where to improve.

The AI personas are designed to challenge you with realistic objections, interruptions, and pushback - just like you'd encounter on actual cold calls.

### Before You Start

Before starting a practice session, make sure you have:

- [ ] Using Chrome browser (recommended for best audio quality)
- [ ] Microphone connected and working
- [ ] Quiet environment for clear audio
- [ ] Logged into your account

### Choosing a Persona

Each persona represents a different type of prospect you might encounter. They vary in difficulty and the challenges they present:

| Persona | Role | Difficulty | What to Expect |
|---------|------|------------|----------------|
| Sarah Chen | CFO | Hard | Skeptical, ROI-focused, no patience for fluff. She's reviewing financials and will shut down anything that doesn't immediately show value. |
| Marcus Johnson | VP of Sales | Hard | Aggressive, interruptive, results-only mindset. Gets 50+ sales calls a day and is sick of them. Will hang up fast if you don't get to the point. |
| Tony Ricci | Sales Director | Hard | Combative, tests everything you say. Old-school sales director who respects strength but will challenge every word. |
| Emily Torres | Executive Assistant | Medium | Protective gatekeeper, dismissive. Her job is to keep salespeople away from her boss. Hostile but not impossible. |
| David Park | Sales Manager | Medium | Territorial, defensive about his team. Any suggestion of improvement is an insult. Sees callers as pests. |
| Lisa Martinez | Head of Operations | Medium | Stressed, wants solutions but hates process. Has no bandwidth for pleasantries but might engage if you hit the right pain point. |

**Tip:** Start with Medium difficulty personas (Emily, David, or Lisa) to build confidence before tackling the Hard ones (Sarah, Marcus, or Tony).

### Step-by-Step: Running a Practice Session

#### 1. Navigate to Practice

- Click "Practice" in the main navigation
- You'll see the persona selection screen with cards for each AI prospect

#### 2. Select Your Persona

- Review the difficulty levels and descriptions
- Click on a persona card to select them
- Read the scenario brief that appears - this gives context for the call

#### 3. Start the Call

- Click the "Start Call" button
- Allow microphone access when prompted (first time only)
- Wait for the connection (1-2 seconds)
- The AI will answer as that persona - typically with a short, curt greeting

#### 4. During the Call

- Speak naturally as if on a real cold call
- The AI responds in real-time based on what you say
- Apply Underdog Sales techniques:
  - Permission-based opener
  - Problem-focused pitch
  - Discovery questions to get examples
  - Calm objection handling
  - Negative framing to close
- The call continues until you or the AI ends it

#### 5. End the Call

- Click "End Call" when you're done
- Or the AI may hang up if you trigger a realistic dismissal (this is normal!)
- Wait for scoring to process (5-10 seconds)

#### 6. Review Your Results

- You'll be redirected to the results page
- See your overall score and breakdown by dimension
- Read the full transcript with highlights on key moments
- Review AI feedback on specific techniques you used (or missed)

### Understanding Your Score

Your performance is scored across 6 dimensions based on the Underdog Sales methodology:

| Dimension | Weight | What It Measures |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| Opener | 15% | Permission-based approach, attention grab, clear timeframe, friendly tone |
| Pitch | 15% | Problem-focused messaging, specific ICP targeting, template usage, negative close |
| Discovery | 25% | Getting concrete examples, understanding consequences, finding root cause, staying on the problem |
| Objection Handling | 20% | Pausing before responding, acknowledging objections, asking permission to probe, calm demeanor |
| Closing | 15% | Summarizing key points, testing emotion, using negative framing, avoiding trigger words |
| Communication | 10% | Talk ratio (<40%), minimal filler words, appropriate pace, clear articulation |

**Score Interpretation:**

| Score | Rating | What It Means |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| 9-10 | Excellent | Masterful application of techniques - you nailed it |
| 7-8 | Good | Solid performance with minor improvements possible |
| 5-6 | Average | Foundations present, significant room to grow |
| 3-4 | Needs Work | Key techniques missing or poorly executed |
| 1-2 | Poor | Fundamental methodology not applied |

**Target Score:** Aim for **7 or higher** in each dimension to demonstrate competency.

### Tips for Best Results

#### 1. Permission-Based Openers Work

The highest-converting opener pattern is:

> "You weren't expecting my call, but I hope you can help..."

This approach has an 89% success rate at getting prospects to listen. Always ask for permission to continue - it disarms defensiveness.

#### 2. Focus on Problems, Not Features

Never lead with what your product does. Instead:

- Lead with 2-3 problems you solve
- Let them pick which one resonates most
- Only discuss solutions after they've acknowledged a problem

**Bad:** "We have an AI-powered platform that..."
**Good:** "We've been talking to CFOs who are struggling with..."

#### 3. Get a Concrete Example

The most important discovery question:

> "Can you give me an example of when that happened?"

If they can't give you a specific example, they don't have a real problem. Don't move forward without one.

#### 4. Use Negative Framing to Close

Instead of asking for a meeting or demo, use:

> "Would it be a bad idea to explore this further?"

**Avoid these trigger words:** meeting, demo, calendar, discovery, schedule

#### 5. Listen More Than You Talk

Target **less than 40% talk time**. The best cold calls have the prospect doing most of the talking. Your job is to ask questions and let them convince YOU the problem matters.

### Troubleshooting Voice Practice

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Microphone not detected | Check browser permissions: Settings > Privacy & Security > Site Settings > Microphone. Make sure the site is allowed. |
| Call won't start | Refresh the page and try again. Ensure you have a stable internet connection. |
| AI not responding | Wait 2-3 seconds after speaking. Speak clearly and avoid excessive background noise. |
| Score seems wrong | Review the transcript - the AI scores based on actual words spoken, not your intent. |
| Call dropped unexpectedly | Usually a connection issue. Try again with stable WiFi. Avoid using mobile data. |
| Audio quality is poor | Use headphones with a built-in microphone, or a dedicated external mic. |

## Call Analysis

### What You Can Do

Upload recordings of your real sales calls and get AI-powered analysis with the same scoring methodology used in Voice Practice. This helps you:

- Get objective feedback on real conversations
- Identify patterns across multiple calls
- Track improvement over time with actual prospects
- Compare your real-world performance to practice sessions

### Before You Start

Before uploading a call for analysis, ensure you have:

- [ ] Audio file ready (MP3, WAV, M4A, or WebM format)
- [ ] File size under 25MB
- [ ] Recording is primarily your sales conversation (not music or unrelated audio)
- [ ] Appropriate permissions to record and analyze the call

### Supported Audio Formats

| Format | Extension | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| MP3 | .mp3 | Most common format, recommended for best compatibility |
| WAV | .wav | High quality audio, larger file sizes |
| M4A | .m4a | Common format for iPhone voice memos and recordings |
| WebM | .webm | Format used by browser-based recording tools |

**File Size Limit:** 25MB maximum. For longer calls, consider using a compressed format like MP3.

### Step-by-Step: Analyzing a Call

#### 1. Navigate to Analyze

- Click "Analyze" in the main navigation
- You'll see the upload interface

#### 2. Upload Your Recording

- Click "Choose File" or drag and drop your audio file onto the upload area
- Wait for the upload to complete (you'll see a progress bar)
- Larger files take longer to upload - be patient on slower connections

#### 3. Wait for Processing

The analysis happens in two stages:

- **Transcription:** 1-2 minutes depending on call length
- **Scoring:** Additional 30 seconds after transcription completes

You can leave the page during processing - the analysis continues in the background. Check your Dashboard to see when it's complete.

#### 4. Review the Analysis

Once processing is complete, you'll see:

- Full transcript with speaker labels (you vs. the prospect)
- Overall score and breakdown by dimension
- Specific feedback on key moments in the conversation
- Suggested improvements based on what was said

### Understanding Call Analysis Results

The analysis uses the same 6 scoring dimensions as Voice Practice:

- **Opener** (15%): How you opened the conversation
- **Pitch** (15%): How you positioned your value proposition
- **Discovery** (25%): How effectively you explored their problems
- **Objection Handling** (20%): How you responded to pushback
- **Closing** (15%): How you asked for next steps
- **Communication** (10%): Your delivery and listening skills

**Key Differences from Voice Practice:**

- Real conversations have natural interruptions and tangents - the AI accounts for this
- Speaker detection separates your voice from the prospect's voice
- Context is inferred from the full conversation, not a pre-defined scenario
- Scores may differ from practice because real calls are more complex

### Tips for Accurate Analysis

#### 1. Clear Audio Quality

- Use a decent microphone or phone recorder
- Minimize background noise (coffee shops, open offices)
- Make sure both parties are clearly audible
- Avoid calls where one person is much quieter than the other

#### 2. Complete Conversations

- Include the full call from greeting to goodbye
- Partial recordings may score lower on Opening or Closing dimensions
- If you only have part of a call, the analysis will still work but may be less accurate

#### 3. One Conversation Per File

- Don't combine multiple calls into one file
- Each analysis is designed for one sales conversation
- If you have multiple calls, upload them separately

### Troubleshooting Call Analysis

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Upload fails | Check your file size (must be under 25MB). Try converting to MP3 format if using a different format. |
| Transcription taking too long | Longer calls take more time. A 30-minute call may take 3-4 minutes to transcribe. Check your Dashboard for status. |
| Poor transcription accuracy | Usually caused by poor audio quality. For future calls, use a clearer recording setup. |
| Score lower than expected | Review the transcript - the AI scores based on what it heard, not what you intended to say. |
| Speaker labels wrong | Common with similar-sounding voices or poor audio. Focus on the feedback content rather than the labels. |
| File format not supported | Convert your file to MP3 using a free online converter, then try again. |

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Getting Started

**Q: What browser should I use?**

A: Chrome is recommended for best voice quality and compatibility. Firefox and Safari work but may have minor audio differences. Edge works well too. Make sure your browser is updated to the latest version.

**Q: Do I need to install anything?**

A: No installation needed. Just log in through your browser. You'll need to allow microphone access when you first try Voice Practice - look for a popup asking for permission.

**Q: How do I get an account?**

A: Contact your administrator or manager for login credentials. Accounts are created by your organization's admin. You'll receive an email with login instructions.

**Q: Can I use this on my phone?**

A: The platform works on mobile browsers, but Voice Practice is optimized for desktop/laptop with a good microphone. Call Analysis and Chat Coaching work well on mobile.

### Voice Practice

**Q: The AI seems too harsh - is that normal?**

A: Yes! The personas are designed to be challenging, simulating difficult prospects you'll encounter in real life. This is intentional - practicing against easy prospects doesn't prepare you for the real thing. Start with Medium difficulty personas (Emily, David, Lisa) if Hard ones feel overwhelming.

**Q: Can I practice the same persona multiple times?**

A: Absolutely. In fact, that's recommended. Practice with the same persona until you consistently score 7+ before moving to harder ones. Repetition builds muscle memory for handling specific objection styles.

**Q: Why does the AI sometimes hang up on me?**

A: The AI simulates realistic prospect behavior. If you trigger a dismissal (e.g., not asking for permission, being too pushy, talking too much about features), they'll end the call just like a real prospect would. Review the transcript to see what triggered the hang-up.

**Q: My score seems lower than I expected - why?**

A: The AI scores based on specific methodology criteria, not general salesmanship. Review the transcript to see exactly what was said. Common reasons for lower scores:
- Skipped the permission-based opener
- Led with features instead of problems
- Didn't get a concrete example during discovery
- Used trigger words when closing ("meeting," "demo," "calendar")

**Q: How long should a practice session be?**

A: Typical sessions are 3-7 minutes. The AI will end the call naturally when appropriate. If you're getting cut off quickly, focus on your opener and permission-asking technique.

### Call Analysis

**Q: Can I upload phone call recordings?**

A: Yes, as long as the audio is in a supported format (MP3, WAV, M4A, WebM) and under 25MB. Phone recordings work well. Make sure you have appropriate permission to record and analyze the call.

**Q: How long does analysis take?**

A: Typically 2-3 minutes for a 10-minute call. Longer calls take proportionally longer. A 30-minute call might take 5-6 minutes. You can leave the page and check back later - the analysis continues in the background.

**Q: Why is the transcription not perfect?**

A: Speech-to-text technology works best with clear audio. Background noise, crosstalk, heavy accents, and low audio quality can affect accuracy. The analysis focuses on patterns and techniques, so minor transcription errors usually don't affect the overall scoring.

**Q: Can I analyze calls where I was the prospect?**

A: The analysis is designed for calls where you're the salesperson. Analyzing calls where you were the prospect won't give meaningful results since the scoring rubric measures seller techniques.

### Scoring

**Q: What's a good score?**

A: 7+ is considered competent - you're applying the methodology correctly. 9+ is excellent. Most people start in the 4-6 range and improve with practice. Don't expect 9s and 10s immediately; those come with consistent practice.

**Q: Why is Discovery weighted so heavily (25%)?**

A: Discovery is where real selling happens. Getting prospects to share examples, impact, and root cause creates the foundation for everything else. Without good discovery, even perfect closing techniques won't work because the prospect hasn't convinced themselves they have a problem worth solving.

**Q: How can I improve my Communication score?**

A: Focus on three things:
1. Listen more - target less than 40% talk time
2. Reduce filler words - minimize "um," "uh," "like," "you know"
3. Pace yourself - speak clearly at a moderate speed, don't rush

**Q: Why did I score low on Closing when I got a meeting?**

A: Getting a meeting is great, but the methodology scores how you asked. Using trigger words like "meeting," "demo," or "calendar" reduces your Closing score even if the outcome was positive. The goal is to close using negative framing: "Would it be a bad idea to explore this?"

### Technical Issues

**Q: Voice Practice won't start - what do I do?**

A: Try these steps in order:
1. Check microphone permissions in your browser (Settings > Privacy & Security > Microphone)
2. Make sure you're on a stable internet connection
3. Try refreshing the page
4. Try a different browser (Chrome recommended)
5. Restart your computer if nothing else works

**Q: I can't log in.**

A: Try these steps:
1. Clear your browser cache and cookies
2. Try incognito/private browsing mode
3. Make sure caps lock isn't on
4. Use the "Forgot Password" link if available
5. Contact your administrator if the issue persists

**Q: The page is loading slowly.**

A: Check your internet connection speed. If the problem persists:
- Try a different browser
- Disable browser extensions temporarily
- Check if other websites are also slow (network issue)
- Try at a different time of day

**Q: My session wasn't saved - what happened?**

A: Sessions are saved automatically when the call ends normally. If you lost connection mid-call or closed the browser, the session may not have been saved. Make sure to end calls using the "End Call" button and wait for the results page to load.

### Key Methodology Reminders

**Opener:**
> "You weren't expecting my call, but I hope you can help..."

**Focus on Problems:**
- Lead with 2-3 problems you solve
- Problems are 2x more motivating than benefits

**Get an Example:**
> "Can you give me an example of when that happened?"
- No example = no real problem

**Handle Objections:**
- Pause 2-3 seconds before responding
- "I thought you might say that. Do you mind if I ask a question?"

**Close with Negative Framing:**
> "Would it be a bad idea to explore this further?"

**Avoid Trigger Words:**
- Never say: meeting, demo, calendar, discovery, schedule

**Listen More:**
- Target < 40% talk time
- Your job is to ask questions, not present

### Quick Troubleshooting

| Problem | First Thing to Try |
|---------|-------------------|
